# RestaurantRater

One of the first mvc projects I completed at Eleven Fifty was this restaurant rater app.  This app was designed to show us how to 
divide our code properly, to communicate effectively between model, view, controller, and services.  This app lets a user input a 
restaurant and give a simple rating on their expierence there. 

## Getting Started
